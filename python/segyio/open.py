    """Open a segy file.

    Opens a segy file and tries to figure out its sorting, inline numbers,
    crossline numbers, and offsets, and enables reading and writing to this
    file in a simple manner.

    For reading, the access mode `r` is preferred. All write operations will
    raise an exception. For writing, the mode `r+` is preferred (as `rw` would
    truncate the file). Any mode with `w` will raise an error. The modes used
    are standard C file modes; please refer to that documentation for a
    complete reference.

    Open should be used together with python's ``with`` statement. Please refer
    to the examples. When the ``with`` statement is used the file will
    automatically be closed when the routine completes or an exception is
    raised.

    By default, segyio tries to open in ``strict`` mode. This means the file will
    be assumed to represent a geometry with consistent inline, crosslines and
    offsets. If strict is False, segyio will still try to establish a geometry,
    but it won't abort if it fails. When in non-strict mode is opened,
    geometry-dependent modes such as iline will raise an error.

    If ``ignore_geometry=True``, segyio will *not* try to build iline/xline or
    other geometry related structures, which leads to faster opens. This is
    essentially the same as using ``strict=False`` on a file that has no
    geometry.

    Parameters
    ----------

    filename : str
        Path to file to open

    mode : {'r', 'r+'}, optional
        File access mode, read-only ('r', default) or read-write ('r+')

    iline : int or segyio.TraceField
        Inline number field in the trace headers. Defaults to 189 as per the
        SEG-Y rev1 specification

    xline : int or segyio.TraceField
        Crossline number field in the trace headers. Defaults to 193 as per the
        SEG-Y rev1 specification

    strict : bool, optional
        Abort if a geometry cannot be inferred. Defaults to True.

    ignore_geometry : bool, optional
        Opt out on building geometry information, useful for e.g. shot
        organised files. Defaults to False.

    Returns
    -------

    file : segyio.SegyFile
        An open segyio file handle

    Raises
    ------

    ValueError
        If the mode string contains 'w', as it would truncate the file

    Notes
    -----

    .. versionadded:: 1.1

    When a file is opened non-strict, only raw traces access is allowed, and
    using modes such as ``iline`` raise an error.


    Examples
    --------

    Open a file in read-only mode:

    >>> with segyio.open(path, "r") as f:
    ...     print(f.ilines)
    ...
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    Open a file in read-write mode:

    >>> with segyio.open(path, "r+") as f:
    ...     f.trace = np.arange(100)


    Open two files at once:

    >>> with segyio.open(path) as src, segyio.open(path, "r+") as dst:
    ...     dst.trace = src.trace # copy all traces from src to dst
